superbus is a Burp extension that aims to parse an OpenAPI specification and generate a site map of all endpoints (including params) to ease the process of running a Burp scan.

[Next steps: 
 - Parsing process for OpenAPI 3.0;
 - Include file as request body
 - Improve parser for guessing content-type]
